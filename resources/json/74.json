      "Logic: Main building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical operations like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR\rMemory: Store data. Includes volatile memory (like RAM) and non-volatile memory (like flash memory and ROM)\rAnalog: Process analog signals. Used in audio amplification, radio transmission, and signal processing. \rMicroprocessor Units (MPU): Umbrella term that includes central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and others\rOpto: Source, detect, and control light. Used in fiber-optic communications, display technology, and lighting\rDiscretes: Individual semiconductor devices like diodes and thyristors. Used in power management, switching, and amplification\rMicrocontroller Units (MCU): Similar to MPUs, but don’t need external support chips to create a complete embedded system\rSensors: Convert environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, into electrical signals \rDigital Signal Processors (DSP): Specialized microprocessors designed to process digital signals. Used in audio and video processing, telecommunications, and control systems",
